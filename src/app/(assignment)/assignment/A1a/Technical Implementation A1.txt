For my custom implementation, I made Amongus because I know that Dr. Zhu loves amongus :). In order to make it, I took IQ's 3D SDF implementation of a capsule and used this in my sdf2 function in order to make the figure. I ended up combining four capsules together to form the body, legs, and goggles, and I used the sdfUnion function to combine them together. I also adjusted the color in the phong shading function so it would render to be red.
