In order to train the model and output the SDF, I prepared the training dataset to be sent to torch, then the CUDA GPU. Then, I initialized the fully connected layer and then proceeded to train my network. In order to lower the loss, I increased the number of epochs and added the output to my sdf functions inside my fragment shader. Within the fragment shader, I was able to color the objects by calculating the x and y positions of the passed in position. For the creative expression portion, I changed the cow out for the teddy that my model computed.
