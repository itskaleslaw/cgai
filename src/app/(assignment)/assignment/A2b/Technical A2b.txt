For this assignment, I first encoded the 3D coordinates to help the model capture detail better, and this was using the given formula. Then, I implemented volume rendering, which included using ray casts from the camera to then predict color and density. I did this by following the volume rendering equation in the slides, and adding each sample to compute the final pixel color. For my creative portion, I decided to render the mini drum set.
